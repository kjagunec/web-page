                <h2>The beginning of Game Freak, and Pocket Monsters</h2>
                <p>Pokémon was invented by a Japanese man named Satoshi Tajiri and his friend Ken Sugimori, who is an illustrator.

                    Back in 1982 Satoshi started a gaming magazine together with his friends called Game Freak, but after a while he decided to start making his own video games, instead of writing about them.
                    
                    In 1989 Satoshi turned Game Freak into a gaming company, and together with his friends they released a few games such as Pulseman, Yoshi and Mario & Wario, which did pretty well.
                    
                    In the early 1990s, inspired by his childhood exploring forests and finding bugs and tadpoles, Satoshi came up with the idea for Pocket Monsters (or as it's better known Pokémon), and pitched it to Nintendo.</p>

                <h2>The first Pokémon games are released</h2>
                <p>Nintendo was a bit unsure about Pocket Monsters at first, but eventually accepted, and Satoshi spent the next six years working with legendary game maker Shigeru Miyamoto (the man behind Mario and The Legend of Zelda) to make Pocket Monsters a reality.

                    On 27 February 1996, Pocket Monsters was released in a Red and Green version for the Gameboy, in Japan.
                    
                    The games were on a cartridge, and players could trade Pokémon using a cable to connect to each other's Gameboy.</p>
